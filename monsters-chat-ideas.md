Here are a few ideas from our ASP.NET Monsters show when we tried to "over-engineer" the game!

## Microtransactions

 - buy costumes that improve sales
 - buy new lemonade recipies
 - buy printing press to lower sign costs
 - bribe police to shut down roads

# Identity

 - support logging in
 - Azure AD

# Scalability

 - Orleans (.NET actor pattern)
  - actor for each player
  - send universal events (sugar price increases)
  - send actor-centric events (like daily decisions)

# Game State

 - store in CosmosDB

# Game Engine

 - use Orleans for daily unlock
 - 

# Game UI

 - HTML? CSS?
 - AFrame? WebXR Framework for VR

# Gameplay

 - squeezing lemons
 - picking lemons
